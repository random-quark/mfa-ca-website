## WHAT IS COMPUTATIONAL ARTS?

Computational Arts is an emerging interdisciplinary field that brings together the expressive power of art with the possibilities of computation. It encompasses the use of algorithms, software, electronics, and digital systems as both medium and method for artistic creation. 
<br>
<br>
Artists in this field may work with:
<br>
<br>
* Creative coding and generative art 
* Interactive installations and immersive environments 
* Virtual and augmented reality 
* Electronic sound and experimental music 
* Game design and real-time systems 
* Machine learning and AI-driven art 
<br>
<br>
By integrating artistic vision with technological fluency, computational media artists help shape the future of how we experience media, culture, and digital interaction.
